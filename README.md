# Group 1 Project 1 UofT Coding Bootcamp
## By James, Rubal, and David
## Project Requirements 
* This project has been our groups first opportunity to show employers our collaborative skills and coding abilities. 
* Employers want to see what we can do, but they also want to see how we work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work we have in our portfolios, the more likely we are to get an interview and a job.
## APP Functionailty Overview 
* Our Recipe app is meant for anyone who loves cooking or people who want to learn to cook. This app allows users to not only search written with all the nutritional facts and/or video recipes, but they can post their own recipes to share to the world! Instead having to search throughout Google for different recipes, and going to different websites to post their recipe, people who use our app can get an all-in-one experience!
